This is a reprex for stackoverflow.com and rstudio support.

I have a complicated shiny app but a very small issue seems to be preventing loading two charts together. 
Once you select one date (from the date picker) and load both the charts they load together. 
But as soon as you select another date, load data and update charts, only the first dynamic graph loads while the other one remains at old screen.
I have added print statements to see if the dynamic data is getting updated for both charts and indeed they are both getting updated. 
Then why only the first graph is getting updated?
